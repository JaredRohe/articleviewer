# Article Viewer

## Building and Running the Program
```
sbt run
```
The above command will compile and run the program assuming you have 
the scala build tool (sbt) installed.


```bash
scala article-viewer_2.13-1.0.jar
```
As a second option, you can also run the above command to run the program.  I have assembled 
all dependencies into one jar so it can be simply executed with no compilation.


## Tests

```bash
sbt test
```
This command runs the test suite.
